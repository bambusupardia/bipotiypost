the campaign trail Saturday night, calling the direction of the country since his departure from the White House a ‘catastrophe’ and saying that he could run again in 2024.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We won the election twice,’ Trump said as the audience cheered. ‘And it’s possible we’ll have to win it a third time!’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He said the country was tilting in a ‘woke’ direction and slammed Critical Race Theory, which he banned by an executive order that was rescinded, and made fun of President Joe Biden’s military directives on race and gender that have been pilloried for their political correctness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As thousands of people at an Ohio fairgrounds cheered him on in MAGA hats and Trump-themed T-shirts, the former president warned of illegal immigration, which he said has spiraled out of control under Biden and said the only reason Vice President Kamala Harris made a brief touchdown at the border is because he announced he’d be going there next week.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Trump welcomed the crowd gathered at the Lorain County Fairgrounds, southwest of Cleveland to the ‘first rally of the 2022 election.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We’re going to take back the House, we’re going to take back the Senate,’ he announced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img
