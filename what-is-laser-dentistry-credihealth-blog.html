Today, dental professionals use laser dentistry to treat a wide variety of dental diseases. For example, the field has been used to heal dental complications like gum disease, cavity fillings and root canals.</span></p><p><span>Laser dentistry is primarily used as an alternative to the traditional dental drill. Using lasers helps minimise infection risk, reduce swelling and enhance teeth bleaching agents.</span></p><h2 id=how-does-laser-dentistry-work><b>How Does Laser Dentistry Work?</b></h2><p><span>During a laser dentistry procedure, the dentist uses a high-powered dental laser that emits light energy to facilitate tissue removal.
