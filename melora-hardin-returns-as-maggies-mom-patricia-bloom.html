Patricia spoke with her daughter in the back half of season 2 about Maggie’s breakup with Gary but did not appear in the episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Maggie’s relationship with her mother is complicated. In season 2, Patricia visited Maggie and Eric (Jason Ritter) in Boston. At the time, Maggie’s mother thought that Eric had received her dead son’s (Chad) heart. Patricia told Maggie that her brother died in a car accident while she was at the movies with her friends. However, the truth came out in season 2 — Chad was alive when he arrived at the hospital but had a traumatic brain injury. Patricia made the last-minute decision to donate his heart but did not tell Maggie. Instead, Maggie believed that her brother had died immediately when his car ran into a tree.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9FEmvjJHhA?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p id=h-related-how-many-episodes-of-a-million-little-things-season-4-are-left><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#><strong>How Many Episodes of ‘A Million Little Things’ Season 4 Are Left?</strong></a></p><p>Viewers find out later that it was Eric’s fiance who received Chad’s heart.
