As the rhino charged at them, Roosevelt and the other man continued to fire.</p><p>“Ploughing up the ground with horn and feet, the great bull rhino, still head toward us, dropped just thirteen paces from where we stood,” Roosevelt recalled. “This was a wicked charge, for the rhino meant mischief and came on with the utmost determination.”</p><p>Just three years later, Theodore Roosevelt would face death yet again. But this time, he’d be the one facing a man with a gun.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony1scOdsGaqn6TApsLEpatmm5iarrW1zaBknZ2RqbVwgQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
