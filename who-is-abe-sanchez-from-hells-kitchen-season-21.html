He was born and reared on Houston’s East Side. He is the executive chef of Kitchen Monster Creations, a firm that prepares nutritious meals.&nbsp;In his more than ten years as a chef, he has held positions such as Sous Chef, Executive Chef, General Manager, and Regional Executive Chef at prestigious restaurants. He primarily contributes to the creation and reimagining of menus, as well as the enhancement of client dining experiences and restaurant food quality.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Abe-Sanchez-1.jpg alt="Abe Sanchez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>His passion for cooking did not originate in his childhood. In fact, as a youngster, he was not permitted to enter the kitchen until it was time for a meal. According to his website, chefabesanchez.com, he stated:</p><p>“I can’t claim I grew up in the kitchen with my parents like other chefs.” My mother was usually in the kitchen, and I was always thrown out. I had to wait until it was time to eat outdoors. I’m lucky to have supervisors who let me do what I wanted. I was able to work with a variety of cuisine genres and establish my own unique palette.”</p><p>Abe succeeded at various occupations throughout his twenties, but he “lost concentration on them.” He was, nonetheless, adamant about reaching the top. He was keen to “find something to do, it was career time” at the age of 30.</p><p>People often told him that his brisket and crawfish were the greatest they’d ever eaten. Abe from Hell’s Kitchen then chose to attend culinary school.&nbsp;The reality show competitor fell in love with the profession right away and embarked on his adventure to make it big in the culinary world. According to his website:</p><p>“In culinary school and every kitchen I’ve worked in, I was a Rockstar.” I assigned myself ten years to become an executive chef, but I exceeded my expectations and became one in two years.”</p><p>Despite having ADHD and Dyslexia, he has never allowed his condition to interfere with his abilities. He “didn’t read many books” since they took “too long to read.” He learned the majority of what he knows “by being in the kitchen.”</p><p>According to the Hell’s Kitchen contestant:</p><p>“I can create a million different sauces using a million different methods, but I don’t know what they’re called.” I’m often asked what I’m working on, and I always respond, ‘I’m simply working.’ I could base a whole restaurant menu on that.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Abe-Sanchez-2.jpg alt="Abe Sanchez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite his ADHD, the Hell’s Kitchen candidate works “a 16-hour shift,” exercises, cooks for his family, and performs yard work. What some may consider a disadvantage turned out to be a godsend for Abe.&nbsp;He is now ready to compete against the other Hell’s Kitchen candidates. The next season of Gordon Ramsey’s successful program will premiere on Fox on September 29 at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurcGeZKyZnpi1psaMn6mopV2dsq240maioqyTnbKvedKemKynnmJ%2Fcns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
