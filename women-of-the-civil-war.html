During the Civil War, several hundred women dressed up as men to fight as soldiers. Among the most notorious was Frances Louisa Clayton, who took the name Jack Williams to fight for the Union. While little else is known about Clayton’s life, we do know that she enlisted in a Missouri regiment along with her husband and, according to most accounts, served in both the cavalry and artillery units."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Clayton herself eventually clarified the story, telling reporters that she was not discovered while still serving in the army and that she was actually wounded at Fort Donelson, not Stones River. Furthermore, according to the book <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They Fought Like Demons</a>, Clayton even witnessed her husband’s death just a few feet in front of her at Stones River, but then stepped over his body and charged into enemy lines.</p><p>However her service ended, Clayton then tried to get home but her train was raided by Confederates and her money was stolen. When newspapers caught wind of the story, a collection was held to help her continue her travels, and the last that was heard of her was that she was headed for Washington, D.C.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony4u8yepWanlmLBqbGMnKCvoZxixKK%2Bjms%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
