As the show was still in its early days, the actress thought she’d have to return to her job as a singer for Bette Midler’s Harlettes group. “She’s really in drag. She just was all dolled up,” Sagal said of her character on CBS’ “The Talk” in 2013. “And I didn’t really look like that. So I could go about my normal life.”</p><p dir=ltr>But once Sagal was given the opportunity to wear wigs instead of spending hours getting Peggy’s hair perfectly styled, it was game over for her former career. From then on out, Sagal would become recognized for Peggy and several other iconic characters she’s since played.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tooJWnsrR51qGYrWWdlrGmecqaq56xXaiuqK3LZqmemZyex6Z5zJqpq6GVmXq4tdOhZJygmaGxs7HNZq6aq12Weqm102aqoaenZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
