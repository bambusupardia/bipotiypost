And while there is quite a bit known about her early life—including that her mother is<strong> Gladys Pearl Baker</strong> and that she lived with several different families as a child—the identity of Monroe's father has always been a mystery.

Before adopting her stage name, the star had used the last names Baker (belonging to her mother's first husband) and Mortenson (belonging to her mother's second husband). However, it has been suspected that Monroe's biological father was actually<strong> Charles Stanley Gifford</strong>, a man who Baker worked for.</p><p>As reported by the Daily Mail, according to the book Marilyn Monroe: The Private Life of a Public Icon by <strong>Charles Casillo,</strong> <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Baker told Monroe</a> that Gifford was her father when she was eight years old and showed her a picture of him. "He was a mystery, a fantasy. It was the man in the photo to whom she related," Casillo writes.
