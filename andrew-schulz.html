I was so nervous I actually said ‘Will you spend the LEST of your RIFE with me.’ Here’s to the lest of our rives my love.”</p><p>Throughout their <strong>relationship</strong>, Andrew has always been private about who his girlfriend is. Therefore, the only hint we’ve had is a now-deleted Reddit post from someone claiming to have found her. His partner’s name is Emma Turner and her Instagram handle is ‘@emma.k.turner’.
