His words seem to touch a vein in the struggling ranchhand, finally helping him to get his bearings for this kind of work.</p><p dir=ltr>Considering the level of respect that Taylor Sheridan evidently has for Wilford Brimley, it’s even reasonable to suggest that the character was included in “Yellowstone” to honor the “Country,” “Rodeo Girl,” and “Death Valley” star. As for the actor himself, though he died in 2020, it’s clear from that title card alone that his absence will cast a long shadow across the trail for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OrnKecmaO0cMPIpZ2oqpRir7O1zKWcsqtdrrKtuM6wqq2nnpp6s7vLnmSwoKlitrV50q2gpaRdmLyvstSsnKxllpa7tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
