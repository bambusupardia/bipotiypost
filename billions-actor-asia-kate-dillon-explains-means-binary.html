For some time, Dillon, who also identifies as non-binary and prefers the pronouns &#34;they,&#34; &#34;their,&#34; and &#34;them,&#34; didn't quite know how to describe their gender identity.
All of that changed when the actor first read about Taylor Mason."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"When I got to the script for 'Billions' and the character breakdown for Taylor Mason, the character that I play, said female and non-binary, a little light bulb went off in my head. ... I did a little bit of research and discovered that female is an assigned sex and non-binary is in reference to gender identity and those are two different things. It finally helped me put language to a feeling that I'd had my entire life."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Dillon, 33, said that since coming out as non-binary, they've heard from others who have been inspired by their story. Representation, they added, is important, particularly when the reach is as wide as that of their <a class="zZyg UbGl iFzk qdXb WCDh DbOX tqUt GpWV iJYz" data-testid=prism-linkbase href=# id=ramplink_Showtime_>Showtime</a> series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/asia-kate-dillon-billions-ht-jef-180112_3x2_992.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Sometimes you have to see the thing to know that it exists," they said. "Maybe there's a queer person in a town but they don’t feel comfortable or safe coming out, frankly, and the only representation they feel that they have or connection they have is on television or in a movie, and that’s really powerful."</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">For more about Dillon, watch the video above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZkpi7psPSZ56oZpOkunCRza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpuhnKG2sLrSZpicrJ%2BneqK%2FyJpkpJmkmnqltculpqdlla29ra3Ip6pmpZWWu7R5waKlmqqpZMC1u9GydqKcbWp%2FdH2Wbm9u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
