US ships also routinely transit the waterway in what’s considered a show of support for Taipei.</p><p>The security situation has worsened not just for Taiwan but Japan, where a small flotilla of Chinese and Russian ships recently passed between the nation’s main islands.</p><p>Chinese ships used to appear three times a month for a couple of hours in <a href=#>territorial waters of the Japan-controlled Senkaku Islands</a> in the East China Sea. In recent months, China has sent larger ships which stay for up to 60 hours at a time.</p><p>In this climate, nations like Australia and Japan “need to speak with one voice – and the important message is that we should increase deterrence”, Yamagami said.</p><p>“No one wants to be bullied.
