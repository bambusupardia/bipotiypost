Unlike other films on this list, Atuk was not a horror movie, and it had nothing to do with the devil. Based on Canadian author Mordecai Richler’s 1963 novel The Incomparable Atuk, the film has had a number of directors and actors attached to it, but unfortunately, tragedy has prevented the film from ever coming to fruition."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Based on Canadian author Mordecai Richler’s 1963 novel The Incomparable Atuk, the film has had a number of directors and actors attached to it, but unfortunately, tragedy has prevented the film from ever coming to fruition.</p><p>The first director to attempt Atuk was Norman Jewison. <a href=# rel=noopener>Collider</a> reports that Jewison had enlisted Tod Carroll to write the script for Atuk in the early 1970s, but ultimately moved on from the project to direct Jesus Christ Superstar.</p><p>It wasn’t until a decade later, in 1982, that <a href=# rel=noopener>John Belushi</a> got hold of the script and signed on to play the lead. Unfortunately, on March 5, 1982, Belushi died from a drug overdose at the age of 33.</p><p>Six years later, in 1988, the film finally found its next star in Sam Kinison. In this instance, production on the film actually began, and Kinison managed to shoot a few scenes of Atuk. But as Carroll later told the <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles Times</a>, Kinison wanted parts of the script to be rewritten, ultimately leading the project to once again be abandoned.</p><p>And then on April 10, 1992, Kinison died in a car accident. He was 38.</p><p>Shortly after, <a href=# rel=noopener>John Candy</a> expressed interest in Atuk — then died after a heart attack at the age of 43 on March 4, 1994.</p><p>Soon enough, comedy legend Chris Farley was in talks to finally bring Atuk to the big screen. Like the others before him, though, <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Farley</a> faced an untimely death, overdosing in December 1997.</p><p>To this day, it seems that Atuk was simply never meant to be, and some believe it’s a cursed film.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykwdGsnJ1lnaTDqrHSaGs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
