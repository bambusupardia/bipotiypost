Aoki and Ming, however, had a vision for the brand, which is why they searched high and low to purchase Baby Phat and resurrect the line.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bckonline.com/elements/uploads/2021/05/kimora-lee-simmons.jpg alt width=640 height=418 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“This is the retro brand that’s reborn looking through the eyes of young people like Ming and Aoki,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Kimora Lee Simmons</a> said of Baby Phat in the present day. “My girls have been working with me and going to school – and that’s tough,” the celebrity mom said. “It can be tough, but it’s exciting that we’re pushing that needle forward,” Kimora shared.</p><p>You can learn more about Baby Phat’s line of products on <a href=# rel=noopener>the company’s website</a>.
