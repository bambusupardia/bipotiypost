A group of students and researchers from San Marcos University in Peru recently discovered a 3,000-year-old mummy in Lima, dating it to before the Inca Empire.
As Ancient Origins reported, the students initially discovered the remains of the mummy’s hair and skull in a cotton and vegetable fiber cloth bundle while excavating, then later uncovered the rest of the mummy in a trash pile beneath eight tons of rubbish."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Also located near the body was evidence of ancient flies, indicating the body was left out for some time before it was buried.</p><p>The Manchay people were known for their exceptionally crafted and decorated pottery and intricate textiles. The Manchay were also notable for their long-distance trade with other cultures and for cultivating maize, beans, and squash.</p><p>Their sacred rituals were most often related to the rising sun, constructing their U-shaped enclosures known as “Ushnus” pointed towards the rising sun, which they believed represented a connection between the realms of Earth and the heavens. These spaces were utilized for several ceremonial religious rituals, including elaborate funerals.</p><p>Though the circumstances of its discovery in a trash heap may be unusual, it isn’t uncommon for mummies to be found around Lima. Later, in the same region, the Inca Empire would perform similar rituals that could sometimes involve human sacrifice.</p><p>Last year, a 1,000-year-old <a href=# rel=noopener>mummy of an adolescent</a> was discovered on the outskirts of Lima at the Cajamarquilla site, a dig that has yielded multiple mummy specimens over the last few years. The location features a complex of pyramid ruins and was once a trading hub.</p><p>In another nearby mummy-related incident, a Peruvian man was detained by police earlier this year after it was discovered he had been carrying a 600- to 800-year-old mummy inside a cooler bag. The man told the media the mummy was his “spiritual girlfriend,” and that it had been brought home by his father around 30 years ago.</p><p>After reading about this newly unearthed mummy, read about another <a href=#>mummy found in a trash pile in Yemen —&nbsp;with its insides missing.</a> Or, check out the <a href=#>3,000-year-old Scottish weapon found beneath a soccer field site</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurc2cn5qxXaLCrrnYZqOipZFivaa%2B1A%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
