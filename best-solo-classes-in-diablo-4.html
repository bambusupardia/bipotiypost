What Are the Best Solo Classes in Diablo 4? There are no bad classes in Diablo 4. Each of the five classes in the game can hold their own well enough to complete the campaign from start to finish without the help of other players."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Each of the five classes in the game can hold their own well enough to complete the campaign from start to finish without the help of other players. Choosing a class that suits your preferred playstyle is by far the most important thing to consider — if you’re going to sink as many hours into Diablo 4 as us, you’ll want to do it with a character you love playing.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false><strong>That being said, some classes and builds provide a much smoother experience if you plan on playing solo.</strong> Below, we’ve ranked Diablo 4’s classes from worst to best for solo play based on our team’s experience playing the game.</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>All Altar of Lillith Locations in Scosglen Diablo 4</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Diablo 4 Solo Classes Ranked, Worst to Best</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Diablo 4 Sorcerer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Diablo-4-Sorcerer.jpg><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>As we mentioned before, every class in Diablo 4 is viable for solo play, though the <strong><a href=#>Sorcerer</a></strong> is by far the squishiest of the bunch. While they do have very high single-target and AoE damage potential, they can be easily overwhelmed in close combat.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Diablo 4 Rogue</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Diablo-4-Rogue.jpg><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true><strong>Rogues </strong>are fast, fun, and deal serious damage. The trouble is that their <a href=#>best builds</a> require <strong>good positioning</strong> and <strong>constant resource management</strong>. Melee Rogues are the most fragile close-combat fighters by far, but an experienced player should have no problem slicing and dicing demons without having to worry. Concealment spells can also be used to sneak past large groups of enemies, which is something I valued a lot during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">my review playthrough</a>.</p><p data-characters=185 data-current-count=185 data-injectable=false>Overall, Rogues can be a great solo class for seasoned Diablo players, but newer players may struggle with bosses and small rooms that don’t favor its movement-centric playstyle.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Diablo 4 Druid</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Diablo-4-Druid.jpg><p data-characters=321 data-current-count=321 data-injectable=false>The <strong>Druid</strong> is by far the most versatile class in Diablo 4 and, with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">right build</a>, can be an indestructible tank. Druids are challenging to level in the early game, but with a few Skill Points behind them, they are extremely survivable and perfect for players that find themselves starting at the death screen too often.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>I used a Druid to play through the game solo once it was officially released and noticed I died less often than my Rogue playthrough, even though I was playing on a higher difficulty. With <strong>Earthen Bulwark</strong>, I had a skill I could regularly use to absorb damage and make myself immune to crowd-control effects. <strong>Blood Howl</strong> also provided extra healing without the need for Health Potions.</p><p data-characters=332 data-current-count=332 data-injectable=false>While Druids can seem to be an unstoppable force, they aren’t particularly great damage dealers right now. Though their survivability is fantastic, their damage is comparatively low compared to other classes. I often found myself chipping away at bosses for what seemed like an eternity, but at least I managed to stay alive.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Diablo 4 Necromancer</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Diablo-4-Necromancer.jpg><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Who needs friends when you have your own personal army of the undead? The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Necromancer</a> is one of the most beloved classes in Diablo, and they feel better than ever before in Diablo 4. Thanks to their high damage output, range of crowd-control abilities, and minions that happily tank the brunt of the damage for you. If you’re looking for a class that suits solo play and has a unique playstyle, the Necromancer is definitely for you.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Diablo 4 Barbarian</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Diablo-4-Barbarian-1.jpg><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>The best solo class in Diablo 4 is considered by many to be the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbarian</a>. Despite being a melee-centric class, Barbarians have brilliant movement and can deal heavy single-target and AoE damage without breaking a sweat. High damage and survivability are precisely what you need when tackling Diablo 4 as a lone wolf, and the Barbarian is exactly that.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>We especially recommend the Barbarian to those new to the Diablo series thanks to their straightforward playstyle and satisfying combat. As a long-time fan, the Barbarian was the class that made me fall in love with the franchise the moment I used Whirlwind for the first time.</p><p data-characters=72 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>This guide was written while playing <a href=#>Diablo 4</a> for PC and Xbox Series X.</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
