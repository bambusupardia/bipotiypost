Fighting the boss is one thing, but unlocking him is a whole other task entirely. In order to unlock the boss, you have to solve the Warding Stone puzzles. Here’s how to both unlock and beat the Thunder Manifestation Boss in Genshin Impact.</p><h2>Where is the Thunder Manifestation Located?</h2><img title="Genshin Impact: How to Unlock and Beat Thunder Manifestation Boss" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Location-1280x720.jpg alt=Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Location-1280x720 width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The Thunder Manifestation is located on Amakumo Peak. Just getting there isn’t enough though as there is another step first.</p><h2>How to Unlock Thunder Manifestation in Genshin Impact</h2><img title="Genshin Impact: How to Unlock and Beat Thunder Manifestation Boss" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Unlock-1280x720.jpg alt=Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Unlock-1280x720 width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In order to make the Thunder Manifestation appear, you need to complete the Warding Stone puzzles first. Here are the steps you need to go through in the Seirai Stormchasers Quest Line.</p><p><strong>1. First, you are going to rotate the bottom stone twice</strong></p><p><strong>2. After we’ve done that, then rotate the top stone three times.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Then rotate the top stone three times and the bottom stone five times.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Finally, rotate both the top and the bottom stones two times each.</strong></p><p>If you followed the steps correctly, you will now have the Thunder Manifestation manifest in your world permanently. Even if you defeat the boss, it will constantly respawn afterward.</p><h2>How to Beat Thunder Manifestation</h2><img title="Genshin Impact: How to Unlock and Beat Thunder Manifestation Boss" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Storm-Beads-guide-1a-1280x720.jpg alt=Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Storm-Beads-guide-1a-1280x720 width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Now that we’ve taken care of unlocking it, it’s time to beat the Thunder Manifestation. One of the more intriguing-looking bosses in Genshin Impact, the Thunder Manifestation is basically a thunder bat, so that means for you Baal fans, you’re going to want someone else on the frontlines here as Thunder Manifestation is immune to Electro damage. Luckily, this also means you can get some serious elemental reactions with Pyro characters going on here as well.</p><p>Thunder Manifestation is a flying enemy, so that means having a long-range character would behoove you greatly. The new DLC of Aloy might be a great move here, although you will often see Thunder Manifestation come in close as well to unleash a spin attack. Keep a good mix on hand to be prepared for both distances.</p><img title="Genshin Impact: How to Unlock and Beat Thunder Manifestation Boss" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Storm-Beads-guide-1b-1280x720.jpg alt=Genshin-Impact-Thunder-Manifestation-Storm-Beads-guide-1b-1280x720 width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The main thing to watch out for here is the big blasts that Thunder Manifestation will unleash causing some serious area of effect damage. Along with these, the electric wall attack it throws at you can hurt quite a bit too. These are telegraphed big time though, so dodging shouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>If it is though, bring a character along like Noelle so their shields can help you out. If you manage to get hit by Thunder Manifestation, then you will be marked and its attacks will hit you more easily.</p><img title="Genshin Impact: How to Unlock and Beat Thunder Manifestation Boss" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/thunder-manifestation-boss.jpg alt=thunder-manifestation-boss width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Overall, Thunder Manifestation is far from the hardest boss in Genshin Impact and you should have plenty of firepower to take it down with little issue. Stay away from Electro characters and dodge constantly and you should find it no problem. After the fight, grab the Storm Beads and you’re good to go.</p><p><strong>Genshin Impact</strong> is available now on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, IOS and Android.</p><p style=color:#ff4343;font-size:14px;font-style:italic></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKmupLfOn6uhnZaWu6O72GeaqKVfnMKqsMSsZqCdnqi1qrqMoqSpmZOpeqm71marqGWlo7mwr8pmmKecXZeyosCMrZ%2BuppSav265wKegn52jqa61tc6nZJuno6h8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
