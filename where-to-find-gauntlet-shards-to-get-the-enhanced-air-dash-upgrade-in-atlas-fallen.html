These shards can be found through beacons of light displayed by the player’s sensing ability, but they won’t appear on the map. Other shards found later are also displayed by this ability, so trying to track down the fragments you need can be a bit confusing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/atlas-fallen-shard-location-1.jpg><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>One shard is found on the outskirts of the ruined city in the north. You shouldn’t even need to talk to the nearby NPCs to learn its location, as it’s situated just next to one of the main exits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/atlas-fallen-shard-location-2.jpg><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>Another shard is found south of the town. As is the case with all of these shards, you’ll need to fight through a horde of wraiths to collect it, so make sure you’re well-equipped with <a href=#>strong weapons</a> and <a href=#>powerful perks</a>. Don’t let the other beacons confuse you, as you can’t go past the western cliff just yet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/atlas-fallen-shard-location-3.jpg><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>One more shard is found at the large southern landmass. You can access this location through the small island southeast of the town. Its ruined bridges are still close enough to grant you access to the large landmass, unlike the western bridge that prevents you from collecting the next shards.</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=#>What are the Three Words for the Spy’s Report in the Tithe Road Secrets Side Quest?</a></p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=824 data-injectable=true>Collecting all three shards and upgrading the gauntlet at an anvil will give you a second use of your Air Dash, allowing you to cross the aforementioned western bridge. It will also grant you access to the next major weapon and three more shards, allowing you to continue the story. To top it all off, the Enhanced Air Dash simply makes battles even more manageable, letting you avoid attacks from tougher wraiths with extreme ease.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/attackofthefanboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/atlas-fallen-shard-location-final.jpg><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=false>Later on, you’ll find another upgrade to the Air Dash. This upgrade is far easier to collect as all three major pieces are found in the same place. Simply play through the story and you’ll have no trouble taking full control of the skies!</p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Attack of the Fanboy is supported by our audience.
