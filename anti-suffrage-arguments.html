If you need proof, look no further than one pamphlet from the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage.</p><p>The organization was, interestingly enough, founded by a woman. Josephine Jewell Dodge believed that the average housewife was “worthily employed in other departments of life, and the vote will not help her fulfill her obligations therein.” Dodge also feared that a change in the law would give more power to progressive cities, which she considered “undesirable and corrupt.”</p><p>Armed with this logic, she and her group of followers crafted these six reasons to keep women out of the voting booth:</p>1. “90% of women either do not want it, or do not care.” 2. “It means competition of women with men instead of co-operation.” 3. “80% of the women eligible to vote are married and can only double or annul their husband’s votes.” 4. “It can be of no benefit commensurate with the additional expense involved.” 5. “In some States more voting women than voting men will place the Government under petticoat rule.” 6. “It is unwise to risk the good we already have for the evil which may occur.” <img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-100870 alt="Anti-Suffrage Pamphlet" width=500 height=418 data-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/anti-suffrage-pamphlet1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-100870 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Jewish Women’s Archive</span></p><p>To further underline their point, the group included sassy housekeeping tips in the same pamphlet.</p><p>“Control of the temper makes a happier home than control of elections,” the authors chided alongside suggestions for cleaning paint and boiling fish.</p><p>They even included a handy tip for murdering a suffragette: “If an Anti swallows bichloride, give her whites of eggs, but if it’s a suff, give her a vote.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-100871 alt="Pamphlet Against Woman's Suffrage" width=500 height=407 data-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/anti-suffrage-pamphlet2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-100871 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Jewish Women’s Archive</span></p><p>The pamphlet from the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage suggested that these cherished skills of cleaning walls, removing grease stains, and freshening celery would never be learned if women were distracted by “political hot air.”</p><p>And though the authors seemed to know how to clean basically anything, they had no idea how to sanitize a reputation forever tarnished by political activism.</p><p>With such reasoning, it’s surprising that the 19th Amendment giving women the right to vote ever made it through Congress in 1920. After all, why would anyone want to vote when they could spend their days rubbing walls with fresh bread?</p><p>Next, read about <a href=#>Jeannette Rankin, the only woman in Congress at the time of the vote for national women’s suffrage</a>.
