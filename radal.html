He is now<strong> 26 years old</strong> and born under the sign of Sagittarius. None is known about his childhood. As a result, his name, dialect, and use of Balkanian slang indicate that he is of Slavic origin.</p><p>Furthermore, in a number of GTA mod episodes, he has included his own mom, whom he refers to as ‘babushka’ (aука), which means ‘grandma’ in Russian. As a result, she has since become an important part of his portrait.</p><h2><b>RADAL Height & Weight</b></h2><p><b>How tall is RADAL?</b> He stands 5 foot 6 inches tall, but his body weight has not yet been released.

His first video, “yo want to play Fortnite?” was 26 seconds long. “No, I resigned.” “Wtf, what happened?” Furthermore, the video depicted a minor bug in Fortnite. On his RADAL Twitch website, RADAL has streamed Grand Theft Auto and other Rockstar titles.</p><p>Then, in 2019, he bought several Grand Theft Auto games and “decided to pack a whole bunch of modifications into it” before filming himself enjoying them. Furthermore, in an effort to connect with his fans, he has launched two new series: Q&As and ‘RADAL Meme Review.’</p><p>Furthermore, his videos mainly consist of modifications that ruin the game and him making jokes and responding to them (when he reacts, he usually just laughs). As a result, in his early episodes, he played GTA Battle Royales to imitate PUBG. In addition, he enjoys a wide range of sports, including GTA San Andreas, GTA IV, GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2, and the Multi Theft Auto game mode GTA San Andreas: Battle Royale. As a result, he is highly recognized as one of the best timeline editors of 2017.
