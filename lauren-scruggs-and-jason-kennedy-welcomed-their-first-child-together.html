When they eventually became pregnant, they announced it to the world with a humorous video on Instagram. When asked about her pregnancy experience, the fashion blogger told People:</p><p>“It’s always difficult when a doctor informs you that you can’t have children naturally and you keep running into issues, but we didn’t sit around and mope about it.” We were really fortunate to meet with several incredible physicians and professionals.”</p><p>The new mother also shared that the hardest part of her journey had “four alarms to set every day for months taking medicine,” but they now have an “overall sense of peace” because of their “faith in God” and their family and friends who supported them throughout their journey to becoming parents.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijmq2imrtuv8KrrKCfo2Kur7CMo5isp55iuKa6zZ6bsmWnmrmku8yem2asmJq2s3nFoqmsrF2Ytaq4w2arqJ%2BVqbWmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
