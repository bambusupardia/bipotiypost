There are so many brilliant festive features to pick from, each with their own unique characters that make the movie even better; here are seven of the most iconic!&nbsp;</p><h3>Buddy the Elf – Elf&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/land/1000/e/elf-santa.jpg><p>What would Christmas be without Buddy? Buddy, played by Will Ferrell, is one of the most enthusiastic characters out there. He not only loves the festive season more than anything else in the whole world, but he is just so&nbsp;wonderfully&nbsp;happy.&nbsp;</p><p>Buddy is&nbsp;a beacon of joy and radiates the Christmas spirit.&nbsp;When&nbsp;you think of this time of the year, chances are you’ll think of Buddy. His unbridled joy&nbsp;is infectious, and his pure love of Christmas is such a beautiful thing.&nbsp;</p><p>His kindness and adoration of the holidays is simply charming, and he is the perfect character to represent Christmas.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kevin McCallister – Home Alone&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/1000/m/macaulay-culkin-in-home-alone-aW1hZ2VzMS8yMDIwLzA4LzA1LzAxMj.jpg><p>Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin)&nbsp;is a very iconic character, and for a multitude of different&nbsp;reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin is a youngster who is left on his own accidently at Christmas, which&nbsp;leads to some hilarious situations. He is a festive icon due to his films being set at this time of the year, and his adult-like attitude that is able to fool almost anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>He&nbsp;has a pure heart, despite his actions towards the robbers that invade his home… He sees the best in others, and sees the world in such a simple way, which creates some&nbsp;heartwarming&nbsp;moments.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Grinch – How the Grinch Stole Christmas&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/land/1000/j/jim-carrey-how-the-grinch-stole-christmas.jpg><p>The Grinch (Jim Carrey) is perhaps one of the most iconic, and maybe even relatable, festive characters we know.&nbsp;</p><p>While many believe that The Grinch despises Christmas, it seems as though he&nbsp;simply dislikes those who take the holidays a little too far. The Grinch is a wonderfully grumpy character who&nbsp;shouts and stomps, and someone who we can maybe relate to when we’re stressed ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p>How the Grinch Stole Christmas&nbsp;is a fantastic festive film&nbsp;to watch in the holidays because, of course, it contains everyone’s favourite angry character, The Grinch.&nbsp;</p><h3>John McClane – Die Hard&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/land/1000/d/die-hard-zippo.jpg><p>Depending on where you stand regarding whether or not&nbsp;Die Hard&nbsp;is a Christmas movie, Bruce Willis’ character John McClane&nbsp;is a standout&nbsp;festive&nbsp;character.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re among those who say that&nbsp;Die Hard&nbsp;is a festive feature, then McClane is definitely a Christmas icon. He flies to LA to see his&nbsp;estranged wife and children over the&nbsp;holidays;&nbsp;however, terrorists take over the Christmas party his wife is attending.&nbsp;</p><p>His most notable action within the movie is writing ‘now I have a machine gun –&nbsp;ho&nbsp;ho&nbsp;ho’ on the jumper of a dead baddie; whether you think&nbsp;Die Hard&nbsp;is Christmassy or not, this is definitely&nbsp;a unique festive scene.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Prime Minister – Love Actually&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/1000/h/hugh-grant-in-love-actually-aW1hZ2VzMS8yMDIwLzA5LzA5LzA3Nzk4.jpg><p>Hugh Grant’s portrayal of The Prime Minister in beloved film&nbsp;Love Actually&nbsp;is one of the best things about the movie, as he is a charming, fun and wonderful&nbsp;character to include in your holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>Love Actually&nbsp;is an incredible film&nbsp;that shows every different kind of love there is, and Grant’s character shows that while Christmas is a wonderful, joyous time, stress is still present.&nbsp;</p><p>The scene in which the PM&nbsp;dances around his home filled with decorations is such a great moment, and gets you in the holiday spirit.&nbsp;</p><h3>Howard Langston – Jingle All&nbsp;The&nbsp;Way&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/land/1000/j/jingle-all-the-way-3.jpg><p>Howard Langston (Arnold&nbsp;Schwarzenegger) embodies a chaotic Christmas, as he is a busy father who made a promise to his son that he is struggling to keep.&nbsp;</p><p>He seems to enjoy Christmas, but this film focuses on the disarray that can happen around the holidays, and how much toys, decorations and family&nbsp;Christmases&nbsp;can mean to people, especially children.&nbsp;</p><p>Schwarzenegger’s performance as a panicked dad at Christmas is perfect, and creates such a&nbsp;hilarious&nbsp;and iconic character.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Snowman – The Snowman&nbsp;</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/land/1000/t/the-snowman-and-the-snowdog-interview-image.jpg><p>While The Snowman doesn’t make a single sound or speak a single word, he is a wonderful, charming icon associated with the Christmas season.&nbsp;</p><p>The Snowman&nbsp;is a short festive film that is shown at this time of the year on TV. It&nbsp;is an iconic short with an iconic main character that doesn’t need to say anything at all in order to promote the magic of Christmas.&nbsp;</p><p>The Snowman is a kind, gentle creature that wishes for the Christmas season to be enjoyed by everyone, and is worth keeping in mind this year (2021).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Written by Melissa, who you can follow on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">@melissajournal</a></strong></p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Home Alone 2 revisited: Kevin McCallister takes self-defence a little too far…</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrJyvnZ5is6q4zKxksKGknXquscyoqZqanJp6pLTRoqqtpZGoeqqvzqeqZqyfYsSiwMKhZK2gmah6p7HSraCvnV2osqK%2Fzqdm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
