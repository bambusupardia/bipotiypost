She was born in Ogden, Utah, on August 4, 1947, to Carl and Irma Bingham. She was the youngest of five children.<br>Nancy was a faithful member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and served in many capacities. Her knowledge and love of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ were a great strength to her throughout her life. Especially in her later years, she found abundant peace and comfort through her relationship with the Savior.<br>Being the baby of the family, she was adored and cared for by her siblings. She spent her younger years in Sunset, Utah, where she enjoyed babysitting and knitting baby booties at the same time, earning double pay.<br>She met Theodore James (Jim) Glauser at a young age. They fell in love and quickly began their family, sharing 58 years together. Being a mother brought her much joy. Nancy was no stranger to hard work. To earn money during her younger years, she took in ironing, ran a day care, made suckers and booties, worked deburring parts for the space shuttle, as well as working for the US Postal Service. She and her husband were the proud owners of Tasty Donuts in Kaysville, Utah, for 20 years. They poured their heart and soul into the business, which was evident in the love the community had for it.<br>She was an extraordinary homemaker. Though she mastered everything she touched, from cooking, baking, cake decorating, sewing, painting, ceramics, knitting, and so much more, her greatest joy was found within the walls of her own home being a wife and a mother. She loved her family with her whole heart. We knew with certainty that we were always in her thoughts and prayers. We felt the strength of her quiet and gentle nature.<br>Nancy had a gift for encouraging and lifting others. Seeing her smile or having a quick visit with her was all you needed to feel loved and give you strength. Her unconditional love was felt by all and will be greatly missed.<br>She was preceded in death by her parents; sons, Corey, and Troy Glauser; as well as siblings, Richard (Dick) Bingham, Valoy Scott, and Marie Gray.<br>She is survived by her husband, Theodore James (Jim) Glauser; sister, Carolyn B. Brown; children, Wendi (DeWayn) Hansen, Mark (Cara) Glauser, Chad (Kristen) Glauser, and Amy Glauser Esplin. She is also survived by 14 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.<br>We miss her smile already, but what a joyous reunion in heaven it was. ‘Til we meet again.<br>Funeral services will be held Tuesday, May 24, 2022, at 11:00 a.m. at the Sandridge Ward Chapel (2700 South 1000 West, Syracuse, Utah).
