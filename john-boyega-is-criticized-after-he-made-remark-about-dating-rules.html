The actor addressed why he isn’t in a hurry to settle down in an interview with GQ. Boyega stated:</p><p>“Both [work and job] are important. This has changed. I’m 30 now. I basically concentrated on finding peace and putting myself together from the age of 28. Moving forward with integrity and openness. There is no deception. There is no deception. And being committed to what I commit to.”</p><p>Boyega highlighted his dating habits in the same interview, indicating that he exclusively dates black individuals. He said, ”</p><p>“I exclusively date Black men, and it’s all about chemistry, personality, and ambitions. Is there a connection? Can I assist you? Can you assist me?”</p><p>However, his stance on exclusively dating women with dark complexion infuriated netizens, who were not satisfied with his answer. Users on Twitter offered both support and resistance to his statements on his dating life, which triggered racist disputes. Some social media users backed Boyega, while others were upset with his attitude.</p><h2>John Boyega disclosed his Dating habits.</h2><p>As previously noted, in an interview with GQ, John Boyega indicated that he enjoys dating black women. He also said that when it comes to being romantically connected with someone, he has certain ground rules.&nbsp;While declaring that “I exclusively date Black people,” John Boyega also noted that “chemistry, personality, and ambitions” are all key considerations while dating. He went on to remark that he and his girlfriend aim to have a similar “synergy.” According to the actor:</p><p>“I’m quite selective about the ladies I talk to. They don’t want you in their company. Because you are in the public spotlight, they would prefer that you have a wife and children. It’s the ultimate public relations bundle. My parents, on the other hand, have been married for 35 years. There is nothing this world can do to put pressure on me to be inspired by anybody other than my parents.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/John-Boyega-1.jpg alt="John Boyega" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Boyega’s interview triggered some discussion over racism, with one Twitter user suggesting that if a white star said the same thing in public, it would be considered ‘racist.’ When John Boyega responded to the now-deleted post, netizens reacted even more fiercely. He had stated:</p><p>“When people say they like brunettes or blondes, they are not referring to wigs. My choice is not up for discussion. [sic]”</p><h2>How did the rest of Twitter respond to John Boyega’s racism allegations?</h2><p>Netizens applauded John Boyega for sticking up for himself when he responded to the post. Many people agreed with Boyega that he was correct to be transparent about his dating preferences.&nbsp;Boyega, who earlier made a strong statement at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in 2020, was praised by netizens. Boyega spoke out against racism while supporting victims George Floyd, Sandra Bland, Trayvon Martin, and Stephen Lawrence in his address. During one of his speeches, he stated:</p><p>“I’m not sure whether I’ll have a job after today, but f*** that.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/John-Boyega-2.jpg alt="John Boyega" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Some of his followers also showed their support by playfully tweeting about their want to be his partner.
