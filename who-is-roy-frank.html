The star of Breaking Bad and House of Last Things has a net worth of $2.5 million as of December 2023. In real life, J Mitte, as depicted in Breaking Bad, suffers from cerebral palsy. During his early years, he struggled. He claimed that when he was eight years old, he used to sell sandwiches in school.</p><p>Moreover, he also stated that he did not sell all sandwiches at the same price but rather varied them depending on the person to whom he sold. He used to charge $3-4 per sandwich and never told his mother about it.</p><p>His mother did discover that he was selling sandwiches because he used the proceeds to purchase a game boy. When his mother asked if it was from his savings, he replied that it was from selling sandwiches at school.</p><p>He has also stated that he has struggled to pay rent on numerous occasions throughout his life. He stated that he could make money in general and that he did not have to act all of the time. Furthermore, he stated that when someone earns more money, he or she runs the risk of losing it as bills rise and payouts rise as well. He also stated that you could easily be duped in this business. He is a car enthusiast.</p><h2>Is RJ Mitte single, or have a girlfriend?</h2><p>He is not gay, contrary to popular belief. He was rumored to be dating Jodi Lyn O’Keefe, a 41-year-old woman. The couple was also said to have been together since 2013. According to some reports, they did not have any plans to marry at the time.</p><p>This rumor was debunked because Jodi is currently in a relationship with someone else. The couple was photographed together at the Saturn Awards, and the rumors began to circulate, but they are not a real-life couple.</p><p>Jodi Lyn O’Keefe is a well-known actress who has appeared in numerous television shows and films. She did an excellent job in Prison Break. Her work in The Vampire Diaries is also excellent.
