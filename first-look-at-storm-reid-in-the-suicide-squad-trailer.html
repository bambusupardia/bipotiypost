Having Storm Reid as a part of the universe is truly takes the anticipation of the long-awaited sequel over the top. Take a first look at Storm in&nbsp;<a href=#>The Suicide Squad </a>trailer below!</p><p></p><p>The 17-year-old actress plays Tyla, the daughter of Idris Elba’s character, Bloodsport. The teen herself cannot contain her excitement as she too posted the trailer on Instagram.</p><p><span>&nbsp;The teen excitedly posted, “</span>OMGOMG the first @thesuicidesquad trailer looks sooooooo good. Excited to be part of this universe @jamesgunn.”</p><p>Not sure what the upcoming squeal is all about? Well, according to <a href=#>Just Jared Jr.</a>, here is a synopsis of what to expect from the film.</p><p>Welcome to hell—a.k.a. Belle Reve, the prison with the highest mortality rate in the US of A. Where the worst Super-Villains are kept and where they will do anything to get out—even join the super-secret, super-shady Task Force X. Today’s do-or-die assignment? Assemble a collection of cons, including Bloodsport, Peacemaker, Captain Boomerang, Ratcatcher 2, Savant, King Shark, Blackguard, Javelin and everyone’s favorite psycho, Harley Quinn. Then arm them heavily and drop them (literally) on the remote, enemy-infused island of Corto Maltese.</p><p>Trekking through a jungle teeming with militant adversaries and guerrilla forces at every turn, the Squad is on a search-and-destroy mission with only Colonel Rick Flag on the ground to make them behave…and Amanda Waller’s government techies in their ears, tracking their every movement. And as always, one wrong move and they’re dead (whether at the hands of their opponents, a teammate, or Waller herself). If anyone’s laying down bets, the smart money is against them—all of them.</p><p>Reid recently screened the movie and of course had nothing but great things to say about the film and director James Gunn.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y’ALL!! I just saw a screening of the new <a href=#>@SuicideSquadWB</a> movie, AND Y’ALL AIN’T READY!!! <a href=#>@JamesGunn</a> you are a GENIUS 👏🏾🙌🏾✨</p><p>— Storm Reid (@stormreid) <a href=#>May 21, 2021</a></p><p>In addition to praising the work of Gunn and the overall film, in a recent interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, the young starlet <a href=#>pays homage to Elba</a> as well, saying that “he’s the nicest person to work with” and more.</p><p>“He is incredible, he’s the nicest person to work with but also so focused. It’s so crazy how he can, like, go in and out. He would be his character, and his character is, like, serious and then they would call cut and he would just go back into conversation and laugh and talk and I’m like, this guy is incredible. So he definitely kept me on my toes but we had a great time.”</p><p>The Suicide Squad hits theaters and HBO Max August 6th.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmaW5fZ4Jwssirqq1lnKS8rHnArWSsrJ%2Bnum6%2BxKKbZqGeYsGpsYysrKKbmZmybr%2FQrpidZaSnrqq4xKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
