Explore His Relationship, Parents And Kids Detail</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-15</div><p><strong>Stephen Vogt</strong> hails from a sporting family that values religion. The Cleveland Guardians manager inherited his baseball DNA from his father, a former player and coach. Vogt made his MLB debut in 2007. He was taken in the 12th round by the Rays and played in the MLB for a decade. The catcher played for six different teams before retiring in style last year.</p><p>Vogt blasted a home run in his previous outing against the Angels. But it meant much more to Vogt since his three children had introduced him as he approached the plate.&nbsp;Vogt was appointed the Seattle Mariners’ bullpen and quality control coach earlier this year. The catcher takes over for Terry Francona, the most successful manager in Guardians history.</p><h2>Stephen Vogt Family: Wife And Three Children</h2><p><strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Vogt</strong> lives in Olympia, Washington, with his family. The former Seattle Mariners coach and his wife, Alyssa Vogt, have three children.&nbsp;The better half of the Guardians’ management has worked in a similar professional capacity as her spouse. Alyssa is a former Tumwater High women’s basketball coach. In 2017, she resigned from her post.&nbsp;Alyssa and Stephen met while attending Azusa Pacific University. While at Azusa, Alyssa was a member of the women’s basketball team. The pair subsequently married on December 30, 2007, and the former baseball star has already published multiple anniversary tweets on X (formerly Twitter). Alyssa resigned from her post in 2017 due to family obligations. It was the year after the birth of her and Stephen’s third child, and the obligations were building up.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Stephen-Vogt-2.jpg alt="Stephen Vogt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Alyssa isn’t very active on social media, although she does have a Facebook page, which she last updated in 2019. Payton, Stephen and Alyssa’s first child, was born on September 27, 2011.&nbsp;The couple became parents for the second time in 2014, when their first son, Clark, was born on December 4, 2014. Bennett Vogt, their second son, was born on November 22, 2016, as Alyssa gave birth to him. Stephen and his family previously gave a nice interview to The Olympian in 2016. The former baseball pitcher said that his daughter was bewildered by the chanting during her mother’s basketball games.</p><p>At Tumwater, they would shout, “I believe that we will win,” then Payton, influenced by the A’s audience, would begin chanting, “I believe in Stephen Vogt.”&nbsp;Alyssa has always characterized her husband as a modest guy who never imagined he would attain the kind of fame he has. Alyssa previously spoke with the MLB website about her husband’s amorous side.</p><h2>Randy and Toni L. Vogt, Stephen Vogt’s parents</h2><p><strong>Randy and Toni L. Vogt</strong> have Stephen Vogt as their second child. Danny Vogt, the former Athletics catcher, is his elder brother.&nbsp;His great-grandfather was a preacher in a Mennonite Brethren Church, therefore the new MLB manager hails from a pious background. In an interview, Vogt said that he and his brother were raised with Christian ideals, beliefs, and ideas.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Stephen-Vogt-1.jpg alt="Stephen Vogt" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Randy and Toni made certain that their sons would not see the church as just another structure and did not take their Sunday trips to church lightly. Stephen said that his father stressed the importance of being a leader in a Christian home.&nbsp;Randy worked as a CPA in Visalia, California, and would get up at 3 a.m. to go to work early so he could come home by 3 p.m. to coach his boys. In 1976, he pitched for the Fresno State baseball team before becoming the head coach at Central Valley Christian High School.&nbsp;Stephen has mentioned how significant his parents were in his life countless times. Stephen told NBC Sports that if it hadn’t been for his family’s support and early advice from his father, he may have easily gone down the wrong road.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuv9Oep6GdnmLDsLPTZpyxqJykv6Z5x6KqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGK9or7Ep6usZZGjsW63yJ2qZpyVqa6quI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
