In an era where many decks relied on Poké-Powers such as <a href=# title="Claydol (Great Encounters 15)">Claydol</a>'s <i>Cosmic Power</i> to set up, this was a powerful disruption effect that could shut the opponent down early in the game.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Gallade (Secret Wonders 6)">Gallade</a></b> - Gallade had the ability to knock out almost any Pokémon in the game in one shot for only <a href=# title=Psychic><img alt=Psychic src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/e/ef/Psychic-attack.png/30px-Psychic-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><img alt=&nbsp; src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Colorless-attack.png/30px-Colorless-attack.png decoding=async title=&nbsp; width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt=&nbsp; src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Colorless-attack.png/30px-Colorless-attack.png decoding=async title=&nbsp; width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> with <i>Psychic Cut</i>. It required the player to flip over any amount of their prize cards, and did 60 damage plus 20 more damage for each prize card flipped. This allowed Gallade to hit for up to 180 damage once, 100 damage three times, 80 damage six times, and so on. Against decks that built up one main attacker and attempted to keep it alive, Gallade's ability to OHKO virtually anything was a tremendous threat. In its day, <i>Psychic Cut</i> was an incredible attack. Gallade also possessed <i>Sonic Blade</i> which, for <a href=# title=Fighting><img alt=Fighting src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/4/48/Fighting-attack.png/30px-Fighting-attack.png decoding=async width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><img alt=&nbsp; src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Colorless-attack.png/30px-Colorless-attack.png decoding=async title=&nbsp; width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>, put damage counters on the Defending Pokémon until it was 50 HP away from being knocked out. It also forced the opponent to switch it with one of their Benched Pokémon. <i>Sonic Blade</i> could set up even the bulkiest of Defending Pokémon for a KO the next turn with <i>Psychic Cut</i> or <a href=# title="Gardevoir LV.X (Secret Wonders 131)">Gardevoir LV.X</a>'s <i>Bring Down</i>.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Claydol (Great Encounters 15)">Claydol</a></b> - While Gardevoir's <i>Telepass</i> could utilize searching Supporter cards in the opponent's discard pile, Claydol provided Gardevoir/Gallade's main drawpower.

Crystal Beach was considered by many to be the most powerful card against Gardevoir/Gallade. It made all <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="List of Special Energy cards">Special Energies</a> that provided two or more units of Energy now provide only <img alt=&nbsp; src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/1/1d/Colorless-attack.png/30px-Colorless-attack.png decoding=async title=&nbsp; width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>. Since Gardevoir/Gallade essentially relied on <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Double Rainbow Energy (TCG)">Double Rainbow Energy</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Scramble Energy (TCG)">Scramble Energy</a> to satisfy the energy costs of its attackers, Crystal Beach ripped apart its strategy. Windstorm's ability to discard Crystal Beach was absolutely vital.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Double Rainbow Energy (TCG)">Double Rainbow Energy</a></b> - Double Rainbow Energy was the card most often used to power Gardevoir and Gallade's respective attacks. Although it slightly decreased the amount of damage the Pokémon could do, the ability to essentially have two energy attachments in a single turn allowed the deck to begin attacking significantly faster and recover from knocked out attackers quickly.</li><li><b><a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Scramble Energy (TCG)">Scramble Energy</a></b> - Scramble Energy served essentially as a more powerful Double Rainbow Energy, but functioned only when the Gardevoir/Gallade player was behind in prizes. Scramble Energy assured that the deck was never down, allowing a Gallade's <i>Psychic Cut</i> to be fully powered up with only one energy attachment.</li></ul><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Typical_decklist>Typical decklist</span></h2><p>The deck list appearing below is not official; it is meant to represent an average build of the archetype, not specifically constructed for any regional metagame.

Since <a href=# title="Gallade (Secret Wonders 6)">Gallade</a>'s <i>Psychic Cut</i> attack did damage in multiples of 20, it needed to flip over three prize cards to knock out a Defending Pokémon with 120 HP, but four to knock out a Pokémon with 130 HP. Jolteon <a href=# class=image title=Star><img alt=Star src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/2/27/Pok%C3%A9mon_Star.png/36px-Pok%C3%A9mon_Star.png decoding=async width=24 height=16 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>'s <i>Yellow Ray</i> Poké-Power allowed Gallade to knock out Pokémon with odd HP by flipping over one less prize.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Chatot (Majestic Dawn 55)">Chatot</a></b> - Chatot was used as a hand refresher and free retreater. Chatot's <i>Mimic</i> attack allowed the Gardevoir/Gallade player to shuffle their hand into her deck and draw the same number of cards. <i>Mimic</i>, in combination with its free retreat, made Chatot a fantastic remedy to a poor starting hand.</li><li><b><a href=# title="Weavile (Secret Wonders 40)">Weavile</a></b> - After the rotation of <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Double Rainbow Energy (TCG)">Double Rainbow Energy</a> and <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Scramble Energy (TCG)">Scramble Energy</a>, Gardevoir/Gallade suffered from a lack of energy acceleration and faded from the public eye. However, players began to combo the deck's main attackers with Weavile, <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Darkness Energy (Special)">Special Darkness Energies</a>, and a newer line of <a href=# title="Trainer card (TCG)">Trainers</a>, <a href=# title="Supporter card (TCG)">Supporters</a>, and <a href=# title="Stadium card (TCG)">Stadiums</a>. Weavile's <i>Shadow Charge</i> attack allowed for faster energy attachment to Gardevoir and Gallade, and its <i>Dark Engage</i> Poké-Power allowed attackers to do more damage when they had Special Darkness Energies attached.
