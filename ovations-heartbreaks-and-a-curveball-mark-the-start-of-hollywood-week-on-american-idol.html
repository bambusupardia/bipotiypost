The judges threw the curveball by announcing they would be pairing contestants for the Duets round (usually they pair-up on their own) on Monday night.
The standing ovation also came from the three judges as 21-year-old Willie Spence performed a jaw-dropping rendition of John Legend’s “All of Me” for the Genre Challenge.
