The Democrat was uninjured and spoke about the event later that day at a press conference:</p><p>“I am fortunate. Our crew is really fortunate. A guy entered our office. When we met him, he began firing at me.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Incredibly thankful for the support.<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/C3h5vvn4tD</a></p><p>— Craig Greenberg (@RunWithCraig) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 9, 2022</a></p><p>He said that five members of his team were in the office at the time of the event and valiantly barred the door, forcing the suspect to leave. According to the lawmaker, the rifle was “aimed squarely” at him and grazed his clothing:</p><p>“Despite the fact that one bullet touched my sweater and blouse, no one was injured, and we are really thankful for our safety. We’ve been rocked, but we’re safe.”</p><p></p><p>According to Louisville Police Chief Erika Shields and President of the Local Metro Council David James, Greenberg was the intended victim of the shooting intended victim. While Shields referred to everyone on the scene as “lucky,” the latter referred to the situation as an “assassination attempt.” The guy was apprehended 10 minutes later, half a mile from the campaign headquarters. He had a 9mm magazine in his trousers pocket and a weapon, handgun case, and magazines in a drawstring bag. Chief Shields thought the attack was motivated by politics, Greenberg’s Jewish identity, or the suspect’s mental illness.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Craig Greenberg</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaq5mZnHqovsSepZudopx6pbXSnKysq5Woeqm10macsaiVp7amusKeZKytoqu2t7XNoGSaZZOWurGtyKClZqeWm7aksYysn6inpJ67qHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
