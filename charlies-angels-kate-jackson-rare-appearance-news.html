The show went through several cast changes over the years—including Fawcett departing after one season and Jackson leaving after Season 3—but the women stayed in each other's lives. While Fawcett died in 2009, her surviving co-stars are still friends to this day. In fact, Jackson recently attended the wedding of Smith's son, <strong>Gaston Richmond</strong>. Her appearance was particularly notable, because the actor hadn't been photographed in public in over a decade.</p><p>Read on to see Jackson and Smith reunited at the happy occasion and to find out more about 74-year-old Jackson's retreat from the public eye.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>6 Classic Sitcom Episodes That Are Wildly Offensive by Today's Standards</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/charlies-angels-emmys.jpg><p>After getting her start on the series Dark Shadows in the early '70s, Jackson acted regularly until her retirement in 2007. In addition to starring on Charlie's Angels&nbsp;from 1976 to 1979, she's best known for starring on Scarecrow and Mrs. King, which ran for four seasons in the '80s. Her final onscreen role was in a 2007 episode of Criminal Minds.</p><p>Since retiring, Jackson has only rarely been spotted out publicly. As reported by Entertainment Weekly, in 2006, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>she appeared with Fawcett and Smith</a> during a tribute to producer <strong>Aaron Spelling</strong>&nbsp;at the Emmys. In 2009, she was photographed at Fawcett's funeral.</p><p>On Aug. 2, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Smith shared a video on Instagram</a> featuring footage from her son's wedding to<strong>&nbsp;Bonnie Lane</strong>. According to the&nbsp;Daily Mail, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>the wedding was held</a> in the backyard of Smith's Beverly Hills home.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"There is nothing like family, and ours grew this weekend!" Smith captioned the video. "I'm so endlessly proud of my son Gaston and am wishing him and Bonnie a lifetime of happiness."</p><p>One clip in the video shows Smith and Jackson posing next to one another. While Smith wears a feather-embellished seafoam green dress, Jackson is dressed more casually in white pants, a blue shirt, a beige blazer, and sunglasses.</p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/jaclyn-video-2.png><p>Unsurprisingly, Jackson, who keeps her life private, did not speak out about the&nbsp;Charlie's Angels&nbsp;reunion, but Smith did.</p><p>"I came in, I saw her sitting there, and we just hugged," the 77-year-old told Entertainment Weekly about seeing Jackson. "We couldn't stop hugging each other because she's gone her way and not been in the public eye, I've gone mine, and life happens and you don't see each other as much—but it was like no time had passed."</p><p>Smith also explained that Jackson has known Richmond for his entire life. "She's a friend for the ages, it goes the distance," the 77-year-old added. "She was there when Gaston was born. She spent Christmases with him early on, so it was really meant to be."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/smith-ladd.jpg><p>Smith told&nbsp;EW that&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><strong>Cheryl Ladd</strong></a>, who replaced Fawcett on&nbsp;Charlie's Angels, also wanted to attend her son's wedding, but wasn't able to be there. "[L]ife interferes—though she was there in spirit," Smith said.</p><p>Smith, who was the only Angel to star on the show for its entire run, also reflected on the '70s series. "We really were a team," she said of her co-stars. "A friend is like a present you give yourself. You share the ups and downs, and certainly we did. We did not expect what happened to us on&nbsp;Charlie's. We crossed that bridge together and had fun along the way. We had some heartache, but we had mostly joy."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>This Is Why You Never Hear From Bridget Fonda Anymore</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/jackson.jpg><p>The comment section on Smith's Instagram post is full of fans saying how excited they are to see Jackson. Comments include: "Ohmygosh, I spy Kate Jackson," "My heart stood still for Jaclyn next to Kate my idols!!," "Seeing you and Kate together is incredible!!" and "It was so nice to see Kate Jackson! The original Charlie's Angel's [sic] will always be my favorite!"</p><p>One fan wrote, "I am 100% positive I spotted Kate Jackson and if I did she looks great. Did I spot Kate like I thought?" Smith responded, "You sure did! It was wonderful to see her."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmnKCRp7mqsdJmmKeflaHAbrfArZxmopGYuLS7zWapmqqVYq6xvMSaqZqmk5p6r7HWrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
