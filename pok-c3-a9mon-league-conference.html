 A Pokémon League Conference (Japanese: ポケモンリーグの大会 Pokémon League Tournament) is an anime-exclusive championship tournament that is hosted seemingly annually in several regions in the Pokémon world. Structure The general structure of most League Conferences is similar: Pokémon Trainers must register for the region's Pokémon League, something which they can do at seemingly any Pokémon Center or with a Pokémon Professor, and then must win at least eight of the region's Gym Badges in order to be able to register for the competition."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In some regions, there is a torch with the flame of <a href=# title="Moltres (Pokémon)">Moltres</a> or <a href=# title="Ho-Oh (Pokémon)">Ho-Oh</a> that burns for the duration of the tournament, a reference to the <a href=# title="Pokémon world in relation to the real world">real world</a>'s <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Olympic Games">Olympic Games</a>.</p><p>The day after the ceremonial torch has been lit, in some of the regional Leagues the qualifying rounds begin so as to weed out Trainers who have gotten the required eight Badges, but are not yet skilled enough to continue, and those who survive move on to the preliminary rounds. In other regional Leagues, instead, the preliminary rounds will begin right away, and will continue for several days until the top sixteen Trainers have been decided. At this point, there is a short break in the competition so that the Trainers and their Pokémon may rest, followed by the start of the final rounds.</p><p>In the final rounds, most, if not all, battles are usually <a href=# title="Full Battle">Full Battles</a>. All battles are conducted in the main stadium, and Trainers move up the tournament tree in <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:single-elimination tournament">single-elimination style</a>. The winning contestant matchups are shuffled between rounds, as opposed to using traditional ladder seeding.

While the Vertress and Manalo Conferences uses only a standard dirt battlefield, every other Conference has held battles on various different battlefields, like icy, rocky, forested, grassy, and water to name a few. A standard rule for the Conferences with a myriad of battlefields, is that during the Full Battle stage in the tournament, once one side loses three Pokémon, there is a short break, during which a field change occurs.</p><p>In <a href=# title=Galar>Galar</a>, no League Conference is presented due to <i><a href=# title="Pokémon Journeys: The Series">Pokémon Journeys: The Series</a></i> focusing on the <a href=# title="World Coronation Series">World Coronation Series</a>.
