Pedro also made his hosting debut on Saturday Night Live on February 4, 2023. Pedro is so busy with his career that he seemingly puts his love life on the back burner. He brought his sister, <strong>Lux Pascal</strong>, as his date to the 2023 Emmy Awards&nbsp;instead of a romantic partner. Pedro’s never been married, but he has&nbsp;been linked to a few famous actresses that he’s worked with over the years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>So, who are the women that have allegedly dated Pedro Pascal?

Pedro played Oberyn Martell and Lena played Cersei Lannister in the hit fantasy series. The pair fueled romance rumors when Lena <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted a photo</a> of her and Pedro getting cozy with each other in April 2014, which she captioned “Sunshine love.” Later that year, Lena and Pedro was seen shopping at The Grove in LA, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bustle</a>. Neither actor confirmed if their bond was romantic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In February 2015, Lena <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>announced she was pregnant</a>, and fans suspected that Pedro could be the father. However, the British actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>later confirmed</a> that her then-boyfriend, filmmaker <strong>Dan Cadan</strong>, was her baby’s father. Lena gave birth to her daughter <strong>Teddy</strong> in July 2015. She also has a son <strong>Wylie</strong>, born March 2010, with her first husband, musician <strong>Peter Loughran</strong>. In October 2022, Lena got married to her second husband, actor&nbsp;<strong>Marc Menchaca</strong>, 48.</p><h2 id=robin-tunney>Robin Tunney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Pedro-Pascal-Dating-History-EC-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>In 2015, Pedro was linked to another actress, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Robin Tunney</strong></a>, 51.
