She was first known for the events of her kidnapping in 1974 by the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left-wing organization. She was found and arrested 19 months after her kidnapping, when she was wanted after fiercely for serious crimes committed against members of the group. She has been detained and there is pre-trial speculation that her family's resources will help her avoid jail. During the trial, the prosecutor asked Hearst to join the Symbionese Liberation Army in his own way. However, she testified that she was raped and threatened to die while in custody. In 1976, she was convicted of bank robbery and sentenced to 35 years in prison, then reduced to 7 years. Her sentence was slightly reduced by President Jimmy Carter, and later pardoned by President Bill Clinton.</p><table class=wikibox readability=11><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Patricia Campbell Hearst, February 20, 1954, San Francisco, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Patty Hearst, Patricia Campbell Hearst Shaw, Tania</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Alma mater</td><td class=wk_value>University of California, Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Author, actress</td></tr><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Known for</td><td class=wk_value>Being kidnapped and indoctrinated by the Symbionese Liberation Army</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>2, including Lydia Hearst</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Parent(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Randolph Apperson Hearst, Catherine Wood Campbell</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/patty-hearst-vchn-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Family Member Patty Hearst was born on February 20, 1954 in San Francisco, California, United States (She's 69 years old now).</p><p>Granddaughter of newspaper magnate <a href=# title="William Randolph Hearst biography">Entrepreneur William Randolph Hearst</a>, who was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army and forced into a life of crime (SLA).
