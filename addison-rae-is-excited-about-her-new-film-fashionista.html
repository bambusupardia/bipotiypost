In all honesty, they haven’t signed on a director either. </span><span>The show will most likely not commence anytime soon.</span></p><p><span>Despite receiving a lackluster response from reviewers, Rae clawed her way to the top of Netflix’s Most Popular movies list for the week it was released. The magazine claimed that the picture was in active development and that a decision on a director would be made in the following weeks. </span><span>That’s perhaps why, according to the publication’s sources, multiple studios wanted Rae to be the face of their following projects.</span></p><p><span>Rae chose Fashionista especially because it was the type of film she desired to have on her resume. </span><span>Unsurprisingly, the TikTok-turned-actress promoted the Deadline article on both her Instagram and Twitter.</span></p><h2><span>Addison Rae’s Netflix Debut Is Well-Received</span></h2><p><span>Rae made her acting debut in He’s All That, a gender-flipped adaptation of the 1999 teen rom-com of the same name. She is everything.</span></p><p><span>In January, the actress told Variety that she was motivated by the want to demonstrate to people that she was not limited to one thing.</span></p><p><span>“I want to portray both the terrible guy and the good man,” she explained. “I finally want something as profound, emotional, and genuine as possible.”</span></p><p><span>She was watching Breaking Bad at the time and taking notes,</span></p><p><span>“From the way it’s filmed to the storyline to the acting, it’s all great,”</span></p><p><span>she added before admitting that going through the movie creation process had given her a new perspective on how she perceived movies and TV series. </span><span>Nonetheless, she said she enjoyed binge-watching Breaking Bad and learning from it.</span></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYnZyZqLyvedGanGaho2Kyua%2FIrZydZZGXvLbAjKGcq2WemsRussilpGaekai1qrvNoqqtmV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
