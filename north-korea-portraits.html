Unfortunately, she’s now facing possible jail time for failing to save the portraits of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong Il</a> and his late father, Kim Il Sung, instead.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Latin Times</a>, the Ministry of State Security has initiated an investigation following the Dec. 30, 2019 incident in the Hamgyong Province. Though the parents were not there when the blaze began, they rushed home as soon as they heard about it and saved their kids.</p><p>North Korean law dictates that all citizens display portraits of the two deceased and former rulers of the country in their homes. This mandate is taken quite seriously and inspectors reportedly barge into people’s homes at odd hours to confirm the portraits are properly displayed.</p><p>Perhaps even more Kafkaesque is the fact that the mother is reportedly unable to properly care for her injured children, who suffered burns from the fire. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to People</a>, the desperate mother has been begging locals for money so she could buy the necessary antibiotics to treat her children’s injuries, but she has apparently struggled there as well. Her neighbors — though eager to help — fear that the government will charge them with political crimes if they did give money to the distraught mother.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-258317 alt="Painting Of Kim Jong Il" width=600 height=800 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/painting-of-kim-jong-il.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-258317 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>A portrait of Kim Jong-il, utterly mythologized as a God and a perfect being with no faults.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Daily NK</a>, which is a South Korea-based news outlet that reports exclusively on North Korean events, the inferno surrounded the entire residence. The home was shared between two families and the mothers and fathers of the children were outside of the house together when the fire broke out.</p><p>While the one mother currently under investigation failed to save the portraits of the first and second rulers of North Korea, the other mother managed to do so with the help of a young farmworker. She was consequently able to avoid a criminal investigation.</p><p>Though the farm laborer had only recently been released from prison for a violent offense, he’s being celebrated as a hero by the government. In North Korea, those who save portraits of the Kim family from fires are commonly hailed as such. Those who don’t, of course, face legal sanction.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-258320 alt="Kim Il Sung And Kim Jong Il Statues" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/kim-il-sung-and-kim-jong-il-statues.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-258320 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>When Kim Jong-il died in 2011, North Koreans were terrified of being sent to labor camps for not mourning enough. Footage of the exaggerated grief showcases just how scared they are of their government.</span></p><p>Footage of citizens crying at the funeral of Kim Jong Il in 2011 showed just how tight a grip the government has on its people. While some surely wept with genuine distress that their dear leader was gone, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">others were undoubtedly terrified</a> of being seen as not remorseful enough.</p><p>Unfortunately, a North Korean prison term means more than a bed and three square meals per day. Should this woman be found guilty, she will most certainly not only endure a long sentence but be forced to engage in hard, physical labor throughout.</p><p>The country is notoriously embattled by sanctions, utterly inhumane and dictatorial rule, and a tragic scarcity of resources. It was only a year ago that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Jong-un demanded every citizen produce and deliver 220 pounds of feces</a> per day to combat the country’s fertilizer crisis.</p><p>Of course, citizens were also permitted to pay the government a cash fee, instead. With its stunning, seemingly endless gauntlet of legal and bureaucratic trapdoors for its citizens, North Korea continues to shock and surprise the rest of the world, decade after decade.</p><p>Next, take a look at rare photos documenting <a href=#>life inside North Korea</a>.
