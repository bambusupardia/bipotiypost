Curiously, giant phantom jellyfish are present in every ocean on Earth except the Arctic, but they are encountered at higher depths in the Antarctic.</p><p>The reason for this is still unknown.</p><p>One potential explanation, according to Moore, is that the jellyfish may swim to higher depths in order to expose themselves to ultraviolet radiation and get rid of parasites.</p><p>It’s also possible that the upwelling deep water found in the Southern Ocean simply carries the jellyfish upward.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-425840 alt="Giant Phantom Jellyfish" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/giant-phantom-jellyfish-off-californian-coast.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-425840 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute</span><span class=caption-body>The giant phantom jellyfish has been observed with a small fish living alongside it in a mutually beneficial relationship. The fish receives shelter and protection, and in return, keeps parasites from attaching to the jellyfish.</span></p><p>In any case, these recent sightings are changing what scientists know about the mysterious deep-sea creatures. Of course, our understanding of giant phantom jellyfish has historically been limited by a number of factors, primarily cost and technology.</p><p>Until recently, it was extremely difficult for researchers to reach the depths of the ocean. The <a href=# rel=noopener>deepest dive on record</a> took place in 2019 and reached a depth of roughly 36,000 feet, and even though technology has improved to allow for these remarkable deep dives, it was still incredibly expensive.</p><p>Because of this, researchers have had a difficult time observing creatures that can only be found in the deepest parts of the ocean — though Moore and Viking Expeditions are hoping to change that.</p><p>“It is extraordinary that we know so little about such large marine creatures as the giant phantom jellyfish,” Moore told <a href=# rel=noopener>Forbes</a>. “However now we have the means to make regular observations at greater depths than previously possible, which provides an exciting opportunity for discovery.”</p><p>Viking Expeditions bills itself as “the thinking person’s cruise,” aiming to enlighten its passengers about each destination’s history, heritage, and environments, both natural and built.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-425876 alt="Viking Expedition Ship's Submarine" width=900 height=600 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viking-expedition-ship-submarine.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-425876 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Viking</span><span class=caption-body>A Viking Expedition ship’s submarine.</span></p><p>This dedication to science and research is especially prominent on the company’s two 378-passenger expedition ships, Viking Polaris and Viking Octantis, which have resident scientists, onboard laboratories, and expedition teams of at least 36 experts on every cruise.</p><p>Viking also has scientific partnerships with several prestigious labs, including the University of Cambridge’s Scott Polar Research Institute, the Norwegian Institute of Water Research, the Norwegian Polar Institute, and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</p><p>Researchers from these labs often perform field research on Viking cruises, and guests can interact with them to learn more about their research.</p><p>“At the core of Viking Expeditions is the goal to do meaningful scientific work,” Viking’s chairman, Torstein Hagen, told Forbes.</p><p>Part of this goal includes allowing guests to explore the underwater world at no extra cost via the expedition ships’ yellow submarines (appropriately named John, Paul, George, and Ringo). The submarines have enough space for six guests and a pilot, who can observe the world beneath the surface through 270-degree spherical windows.</p><p>And while these tours are designed to help guests learn and enjoy their time aboard the ships, they are also proving to be beneficial for the scientific community and researchers hoping to discover more about Earth’s oceans.</p><p>In fact, following the new study from Moore and other Viking scientists, Viking is now the first cruise liner to publish a scientific paper.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-425875 alt="Viking Expedition Ship In Antarctica" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/viking-expedition-ship-in-antarctica.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-425875 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Viking</span><span class=caption-body>Viking Octantis in Antarctica.</span></p><p>That said, these explorations don’t come without risk.</p><p>On Feb. 2, 2023, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that it would be joining an international investigation into four deaths and other casualties involving U.S. citizens on passenger tours of the Antarctic — including one death on the Viking Polaris.</p><p>The U.S. Coast Guard said the Antarctic environment poses a “unique high-risk” to explorers, and they hope to improve marine safety and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.</p><p>Looking to learn more about the mysteries of jellyfish?
